## Introduction & Motivation

Accurate energy time series prediction is crucial for power generation planning and allocation. However, existing deep learning methods face limitations due to the multi-scale time dynamics and irregularity of real-world energy data. Our proposed model, EnergyPatchTST, is an extension of the Patch Time Series Transformer specifically designed for energy forecasting. It addresses the unique challenges of energy time series by incorporating multi-scale feature extraction, uncertainty estimation through a probabilistic prediction framework, integration of future known variables, and a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy leveraging transfer learning.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you are using Python 3.9 and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data set preparation

Due to the storage space limitations of GitHub, some data sets may need to be downloaded separately. However, some small data sets have been included in the repository for demonstration purposes. If you encounter any issues with the data sets, please contact us via email [liwei008009@163.com](mailto:liwei008009@163.com).

## Model Overview

EnergyPatchTST is built upon the PatchTST architecture and introduces several key enhancements for energy forecasting. It processes time series data at different temporal resolutions to capture short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. The model also incorporates future known variables such as weather forecasts through a specialized projection pathway. Additionally, it provides reliable uncertainty estimates using a Monte Carlo dropout mechanism and employs a pre-training and fine-tuning approach to effectively leverage general time series datasets.

## Key Features

- **Multi-scale Feature Extraction**: Captures patterns at different time resolutions, from immediate fluctuations to daily and seasonal patterns.
- **Uncertainty Estimation**: Provides probabilistic forecasts with calibrated prediction intervals using a Monte Carlo dropout mechanism.
- **Future Variables Integration**: Incorporates known future variables such as temperature and wind speed forecasts to improve forecast accuracy.
- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: Utilizes transfer learning by pre-training on general time series datasets and fine-tuning on specific energy datasets.

## Experiment Results

The experimental results demonstrate that EnergyPatchTST consistently outperforms baseline methods across different prediction horizons. It achieves a reduction in forecasting error by 7-12% while providing reliable uncertainty estimates. The model shows significant performance improvements for longer horizons, highlighting the effectiveness of its multi-scale approach for capturing long-term patterns.
